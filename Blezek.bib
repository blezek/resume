More likely, one is only trading one set of problems for another, including greater latency (aka slower turnaround times) since the image data must now leave the local area network and travel longer paths via encrypted tunnels. To offset this, an imaging system design is needed that reduces the number of high-latency image transmissions, yet can still leverage cloud strengths. This work explores the requirements for such a design.},

  abstract      = {SimpleITK is a new interface to the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) designed to facilitate rapid prototyping, education and scientific activities via high level programming languages. ITK is a templated C++ library of image processing algorithms and frameworks for biomedical and other applications, and it was designed to be generic, flexible and extensible. Initially, ITK provided a direct wrapping interface to languages such as Python and Tcl through the WrapITK system. Unlike WrapITK, which exposed ITK's complex templated interface, SimpleITK was designed to provide an easy to use and simplified interface to ITK's algorithms. It includes procedural methods, hides ITK's demand driven pipeline, and provides a template-less layer. Also SimpleITK provides practical conveniences such as binary distribution packages and overloaded operators. Our user-friendly design goals dictated a departure from the direct interface wrapping approach of WrapITK, toward a new facade class structure that only exposes the required functionality, hiding ITK's extensive template use. Internally SimpleITK utilizes a manual description of each filter with code-generation and advanced C++ meta-programming to provide the higher-level interface, bringing the capabilities of ITK to a wider audience.

Cryoablation is a safe and effective palliative treatment for skeletal metastases, providing immediate and long term pain relief, increasing mobility and improving quality of life. Ideally, lesions are encompassed by an ice ball and frozen to a sufficiently low temperature to ensure cell death. "Lethal ice" is the term used to describe regions within the ice ball where cell death occurs. Failure to achieve lethal ice in all portions of a lesion may explain the high recurrence rate currently observed. Tracking growth of lethal ice is critical to success of percutaneous ablations, however, no practical methods currently exist for non-invasive temperature monitoring. Physicians lack planning tools which provide accurate estimation of the ice formation. Simulation of ice formation, while possible, is computationally demanding and too time consuming to be of clinical utility. We developed the computational framework for the simulation, acceleration strategies for multicore Intel x86 and IBM Cell architectures, and performed preliminary validation of the simulation. Our results demonstrate that the streaming SIMD implementation has better performance and scalability. Both accelerated and non-accelerated algorithms demonstrate good agreement between simulation and manually identified ice ball boundaries in phantom and patient images. Our results show promise for the development of novel cryoablation planning tools with real-time monitoring capability for clinical use.},

  abstract        = {Accurate segmentation of lung nodules is crucial in the development of imaging biomarkers for predicting malignancy of the nodules. Manual segmentation is time consuming and affected by inter-observer variability. We evaluated the robustness and accuracy of a publically available semiautomatic segmentation algorithm that is implemented in the 3D Slicer Chest Imaging Platform (CIP) and compared it with the performance of manual segmentation. CT images of 354 manually segmented nodules were downloaded from the LIDC database. Four radiologists performed the manual segmentation and assessed various nodule characteristics. The semiautomatic CIP segmentation was initialized using the centroid of the manual segmentations, thereby generating four contours for each nodule. The robustness of both segmentation methods was assessed using the region of uncertainty (δ) and Dice similarity index (DSI). The robustness of the segmentation methods was compared using the Wilcoxon-signed rank test (pWilcoxon<0.05). The Dice similarity index (DSIAgree) between the manual and CIP segmentations was computed to estimate the accuracy of the semiautomatic contours. The median computational time of the CIP segmentation was 10 s. The median CIP and manually segmented volumes were 477 ml and 309 ml, respectively. CIP segmentations were significantly more robust than manual segmentations (median δCIP = 14ml, median dsiCIP = 99% vs. median δmanual = 222ml, median dsimanual = 82%) with pWilcoxon~10-16. The agreement between CIP and manual segmentations had a median DSIAgree of 60%. While 13% (47/354) of the nodules did not require any manual adjustment, minor to substantial manual adjustments were needed for 87% (305/354) of the nodules. CIP segmentations were observed to perform poorly (median DSIAgree≈50%) for non-/sub-solid nodules with subtle appearances and poorly defined boundaries. Semi-automatic CIP segmentation can potentially reduce the physician workload for 13% of nodules owing to its computational efficiency and superior stability compared to manual segmentation. Although manual adjustment is needed for many cases, CIP segmentation provides a preliminary contour for physicians as a starting point.},

  abstract        = {Early identification of ischemic stroke plays a significant role in treatment and potential recovery of damaged brain tissue. In noncontrast CT (ncCT), the differences between ischemic changes and healthy tissue are usually very subtle during the hyperacute phase (< 8 h from the stroke onset). Therefore, visual comparison of both hemispheres is an important step in clinical assessment. A quantitative symmetry-based analysis of texture features of ischemic lesions in noncontrast CT images may provide an important information for differentiation of ischemic and healthy brain tissue in this phase. One hundred thirty-nine (139) ncCT scans of hyperacute ischemic stroke with follow-up magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted (MR-DW) images were collected. The regions of stroke were identified in the MR-DW images, which were spatially aligned to corresponding ncCT images. A state-of-the-art symmetric diffeomorphic image registration was utilized for the alignment of CT and MR-DW, for identification of individual brain hemispheres, and for localization of the region representing healthy tissue contralateral to the stroke cores. Texture analysis included extraction and classification of co-occurrence and run-length texture-based image features in the regions of ischemic stroke and their contralateral regions. The classification schemes achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic [Az] ≈ 0.82 for the whole dataset. There was no statistically significant difference in the performance of classifiers for the data sets with time between 2 and 8 hours from symptom onset. The performance of the classifiers did not depend on the size of the stroke regions. The results provide a set of optimal texture features which are suitable for distinguishing between hyperacute ischemic lesions and their corresponding contralateral brain tissue in noncontrast CT. This work is an initial step toward development of an automated decision support system for detection of hyperacute ischemic stroke lesions on noncontrast CT of the brain.},

Several leading research and engineering groups participated in this effort that was funded by the US National Institutes of Health through a variety of infrastructure grants. This effort transformed 3D Slicer from an internal, Boston-based, academic research software application into a professionally maintained, robust, open source platform with an international leadership and developer and user communities. Critical improvements to the widely used underlying open source libraries and tools-VTK, ITK, CMake, CDash, DCMTK-were an additional consequence of this effort. This project has contributed to close to a thousand peer-reviewed publications and a growing portfolio of US and international funded efforts expanding the use of these tools in new medical computing applications every year. In this editorial, we discuss what we believe are gaps in the way medical image computing is pursued today; how a well-executed research platform can enable discovery, innovation and reproducible science ("Open Science"); and how our quest to build such a software platform has evolved into a productive and rewarding social engineering exercise in building an open-access community with a shared vision.},

Consistent data management is crucial for large-scale modern clinical imaging research studies. If the study is to be used for regulatory submissions, such systems must be able to meet regulatory compliance requirements for systems that manage clinical image trials, including protecting patient privacy. Our aim was to develop a system to address these needs by leveraging the capabilities of an open-source content management system (CMS) that has a highly configurable workflow; has a single interface that can store, manage, and retrieve imaging-based studies; and can handle the requirement for data auditing and project management. We developed a Web-accessible CMS for medical images called Medical Imaging Research Management and Associated Information Database (MIRMAID). From its inception, MIRMAID was developed to be highly flexible and to meet the needs of diverse studies. It fulfills the need for a complete system for medical imaging research management.},

We designed it in a way to allow for scalability, reliability, and flexibility. We implemented several workflows, including one that replaced an existing manual workflow and measured the number of examinations prepared in time without and with the workflow system. The system significantly increased the number of examinations prepared in time for clinical review compared to human effort. It also met the design goals defined at its outset.

  abstract        = {To study an automatic repositioning method to reduce variability in longitudinal MRSI exams based on a priori image registration. Longitudinal proton MR spectroscopic imaging ((1)H MRSI) exams to study the effects of disease or treatment are becoming increasingly common. However, one source of variability in such exams arises from imperfect relocalization of the MRSI grid in the follow-up exams. Six healthy subjects were each scanned three times during the course of 1 day. In each follow-up exam a manually placed MRSI grid was acquired in addition to the automatically repositioned MRSI grid. Then coefficients of variance between baseline and follow-up scans were calculated for N-acetylaspartate, creatine, and choline. In addition, the overall MRSI grid overlap and individual voxel overlaps were also calculated for both the visually and automatically repositioned voxels. Streamlined workflow, reduced variability of metabolite concentration measurements, and increased voxel overlaps are noted when this automatic repositioning procedure is compared to the visual MRSI grid repositioning approach. Our results suggest that this approach is able to improve reproducibility in longitudinal MRS exams.},

  abstract        = {MRA is widely accepted as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for the detection of intracranial aneurysms, but detection is still a challenging task with rather low detection rates. Our aim was to examine the performance of a computer-aided diagnosis algorithm for detecting intracranial aneurysms on MRA in a clinical setting. Aneurysm detectability was evaluated retrospectively in 48 subjects with and without computer-aided diagnosis by 6 readers using a clinical 3D viewing system. Aneurysms ranged from 1.1 to 6.0 mm (mean = 3.12 mm, median = 2.50 mm). We conducted a multireader, multicase, double-crossover design, free-response, observer-performance study on sets of images from different MRA scanners by using DSA as the reference standard. Jackknife alternative free-response operating characteristic curve analysis with the figure of merit was used. For all readers combined, the mean figure of merit improved from 0.655 to 0.759, indicating a change in the figure of merit attributable to computer-aided diagnosis of 0.10 (95% CI, 0.03-0.18), which was statistically significant (F(1,47) = 7.00, P = .011). Five of the 6 radiologists had improved performance with computer-aided diagnosis, primarily due to increased sensitivity. In conditions similar to clinical practice, using computer-aided diagnosis significantly improved radiologists' detection of intracranial DSA-confirmed aneurysms of ≤6 mm.},
